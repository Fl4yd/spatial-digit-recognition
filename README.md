 # Spatial Digit Recognition

A pattern recognition system for classifying hand-drawn digits in 3D space using LeapMotion sensor data. The system processes time series data representing 3D finger movements to recognize digits from 0 to 9.

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning solution for recognizing digits drawn in the air using index finger movements. The system captures 3D spatial coordinates through a LeapMotion sensor and processes this temporal data to classify the intended digit.

### Features
- 3D spatial data processing
- Time series analysis
- Pattern recognition for digits 0-9

## Data Format

The input data consists of CSV files containing 3D coordinates (x, y, z) of finger movements captured by the LeapMotion sensor. Each file represents a single digit drawing sample.
